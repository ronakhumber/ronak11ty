# Who is this post for?

This post is for those who are preparing for the coming Internship/Placement season. I am nobody to tell you which website to refer to for the best resources, but I can tell you what I did so that you can learn from my strategy to formulate your own.

# About my experience

I joined the Interview Preparation course at Pepcoding (http://pepcoding.com/), which is a coding institute in New Delhi started by Sumeet Sir in December 2017. We were given a comprehensive list of 400 questions which we solved together in the class and coded all of them during the summer break.

# Leetcode

leetcode.com has a plenty of coding questions to practice your skills. This website is famous for its test cases. Can you believe I got stuck at “Reverse a Number” question which is considered to be the easiest of all? This website has practice questions which were previously asked in companies and provides a good hands-on experience of solving problems with a very cool interface. I would suggest you solve the questions from interviewbit first and then move to geeks to further find out that you’ve already done plenty of the questions.

# What is the best way to utilize these resources?

But, Sooner or later you will realize solving problems is still a doable task with all the available resources to find solutions and rather well-explained solutions on websites like geeksforgeeks.org, one needs to figure out another way to stay in touch with all the questions so as to not forget the strategy to solve different kinds of questions. You will probably spend the two months of summer holidays to solve plenty of questions but what to do when you have your interview in 2 days. How to formulate a strategy of revision? What all questions to revise in what order? How to read the complete text of geeks when revising

1. Notes
Make personal notes, handwritten notes of each and every question which seems difficult to you so as to keep the revision process easy at a later stage.

2. The Problem with geeksforgeeks is the absence of tracking your progress and making notes altogether on the platform. For solving this problem, I made a tool GeekAssistant last year to aid my interview preparation process and I want every one of you to utilize this to the fullest.
