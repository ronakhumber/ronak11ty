        <h1>DTU Farewell 2020</h1>
<p>I graduated from Delhi Technological University in 2020. If you still remember, that was the first year of the Covid-19 Pandemic. There was a lockdown all over the world, and things in New Delhi were not going any better. In normal times, we have a farewell party in our university consisting of Dance, music and everyone writing short farewell messages on each other's tshirts. These messages are called scribbles.</p>
<p>With everything going Online, and our colleges being shut down, I along with my friends decided to make a website and try to replicate what we do in an offline farewell. We created a social media website for our farewell in a few days, built on <strong>PHP Codeigniter framework and Mysql database</strong> and launched it to our batch of more than 2000 students.</p>
